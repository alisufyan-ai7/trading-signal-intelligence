# Decision Log

This file records material product, data and architecture decisions. New entries should be appended rather than silently rewriting history.

## 2026-09-16 — D001: Repo is the source of truth

**Decision:** Major strategy definitions, research conclusions, architecture decisions and implementation status live in this repository rather than only in chat.

**Reason:** The project needs durable, reviewable state and reproducible research.

## 2026-09-16 — D002: MT5 + Python replaces MetaApi as the initial broker connector

**Decision:** Use the official MetaTrader5 Python package with a local Windows MetaTrader 5 terminal for initial multi-asset R&D.

**Initial broker:** Exness demo.

**Reason:** It avoids an additional middleware subscription and gives direct access to the instruments/data exposed to the logged-in MT5 terminal.

**Constraint:** This is an R&D decision, not a conclusion that Exness data is licensed for commercial SaaS-derived signals.

## 2026-09-16 — D003: Binance direct for crypto

**Decision:** Use Binance's direct REST/WebSocket market-data interfaces as the primary crypto source; use broker crypto CFDs only for comparison or broker-specific strategy research.

**Reason:** Direct exchange data avoids unnecessary broker-CFD basis differences and gives a cleaner crypto research source.

## 2026-09-16 — D004: No raw-feed redistribution in v1

**Decision:** The SaaS is designed around derived signals, scores, explanations and performance records—not streaming raw broker prices or cloning broker charts.

**Reason:** Product focus and reduced data-licensing exposure. This does not eliminate the need to confirm commercial rights for using source data to create derived products.

## 2026-09-16 — D005: Exness production-data status is blocked pending clarification

**Decision:** Exness demo/MT5 may be used for prototyping and R&D, but Exness is not assumed to be an approved production commercial signal-data source.

**Reason:** The current Exness (VG) Client Agreement (version 24 July 2026) states in its prohibited-actions section that accessing/collecting/storing/using market data, price feeds, quotes or platform data for purposes other than the client's own genuine trading—including an external platform/system/product/service—is prohibited. The current API Terms also grant API use for managing the client's account and executing transactions in good faith.

**Next action:** Obtain written clarification/permission for server-side calculation of proprietary commercial derived signals without redistributing raw market data, or select an alternative licensed production source.

## 2026-09-16 — D006: Quantitative engine first, AI second

**Decision:** Strategy rules/risk logic generate candidate signals; AI explains/contextualizes them downstream.

**Reason:** Better reproducibility, lower model cost, easier validation and clearer performance attribution.

## 2026-09-16 — D007: Verified forward record is a core product feature

**Decision:** Once live testing starts, the system stores original signal parameters immutably and automatically evaluates outcomes.

**Reason:** The long-term product moat should be evidence and transparency rather than unverifiable "AI confidence" marketing.
